*Answer the following questions in regards to the student's project you are reviewing. Include code snippets in your answers when relevant.*


### Are you able to produce any errors or unexpected results?

+ I was able to submit the form with out my name.  The placeholder text states that the name is required, but in actuality it is not.
+ I would suggest adding the `required` html tag in the form.

### Referencing the course notes on [Form design flow](https://hesweb.dev/e2/notes#/php/form-flow), describe the form design flow used in this project.

+ This was form design C - which I also used for my project.  For this project, I believe it was the correct choice, as it
 allowed the user to submit and see the results on the home page, and carry over some of the variables (name, email). 

### Are there any separation of concern issues (i.e. non-display specific logic in view files, display code in controller files)? 

+ None that I could see.

### Are there aspects of the code that you feel were not self-evident and would benefit from comments?

+ Code was well commented.  Not over commented either.  

### List any/all built-in PHP methods used with a brief summary of what the method does

+ She used `isset` - which checks if a particular variable has a value.
+ She used `$_SESSIONS` - which stores variables for use in other files.

### Are there any parts of the code that you found interesting or taught you something new?

+ No.  I liked it, and thought she did a great job, but the code was straightforward.

### Are there any parts of the code that you don't understand?

+ I believe she has a extra **php closing bracket "}" ** on line 92 of `index.php`.  I looked, but could not find the php element she was closing. 

### Are there any best practices discussed in course material that you feel were not addressed in the code?

+ Not that I could see.

### Do you have any additional comments not covered in the above questions?

+ Great job!
