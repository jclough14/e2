## Game Planning
* Define the possible options for each player to throw.
	* Create an array with three values: rock, paper and scissors.
* Have each player be assigned the result of their throw.
	* Use 'rand()' function to determine a value between 0-2
	* The resulting number represents the index in the array.
	* Assign the result to a variable for each player.
	* Keep track of the results in an array for each player.
* Determine a winner
	* Using a series of 'if' and ifelse' statements, determine who won the game.
	* Keep track of the winner in an array
	* Keep track of the score by incrementing a variable for each player.
	* Increment the number of games variable regardless of outcome.
* Loop until you have a winner
	* Use a 'while' loop to keep having games until one player gets 3 wins.
* Output results
	* Use a 'for' loop using the number of games variable to output results.
