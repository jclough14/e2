## Game Planning
* Define the possible options for player to throw.
	* Create an array with three values: rock, paper and scissors.
* Have player select their shape
    * Use GET form and radio buttons to have player select shape
* Select CPU shape    
	* Use 'rand()' function to determine a value between 0-2
	* The resulting number represents the index in the array.
	* Assign the result to a variable CPU.
* Determine a winner
	* Using a series of 'if' and ifelse' statements, determine who won the game.
* Output results
	* Use a 'showResults' variable to hide or display results.
